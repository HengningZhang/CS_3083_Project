## Introduction
The course project this semester is Finstagram , a web application for sharing photos.
Finstagram gives users more privacy than many photo sharing sites by giving them more
detailed control over who can see which photos they post. The focus of the project will be on
storing data about who posted which photos and who has permission to view them, tag others
in them, see who’s tagged in what, etc.
